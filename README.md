# Portfolio-Projects
This is a collection of personal projects to showcase my ability to perform basic data analysis and predictive modeling.

The time series folder contains a sarima model written in R designed to predict the population as a function of time.

The classification folder contains a data visualization portion as well as a comparison of several common classification models.
